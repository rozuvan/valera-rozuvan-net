            <h1>Web Application Framework</h1>

            <p>So recently it was announced to my team that we were going to work on something called the "UI Framework".
            To say that we were excited is like not saying anything at all. For the last month or so we have been on a
            redesign spree. Boring work of applying styling changes to an existing web application. I should mention that
            the web application we are working on - is quite a mess of old JavaScript technologies. So we were excited -
            actually something cool to work on! When you get a chance to do something form scratch within a large
            organization, you are in luck.</p>

            <p>There was a problem though. What exactly were we supposed to build up? I mean the term "UI Framework" is
            quite an abstract term in our case. First of all, we knew that the web application was getting replaced in the
            future by our work. Secondly, we were tasked with creating this "framework". Honestly, aren't there enough
            frameworks out there? Fortunately, after a week or two of conversations the picture started to become more
            clear.</p>
