            <h1 class="with_published_date">Web Application Framework</h1>

            <p class="date_published">published: TBD</p>

            <p class="note">NOTE: This is a work in progress!</p>

            <p>So recently it was announced to my team that we were going to work on something called the
            "UI Framework". To say that we were excited is like not saying anything at all. For the last month or so we
            have been on a redesign spree. Boring work of applying styling changes to an existing web application. I
            should mention that the web application we are working on - is quite a mess of old JavaScript technologies.
            So we were excited - actually something cool to work on! When you get a chance to do something form scratch
            within a large organization, you are in luck.</p>

            <p>There was a problem though. What exactly were we supposed to build up? I mean the term "UI Framework" is
            quite an abstract term in our case. First of all, we knew that the web application was getting replaced in
            the future by our work. Secondly, we were tasked with creating this "framework". Honestly, aren't there
            enough frameworks out there? Fortunately, after a week or two of conversations the picture started to become
            more clear.</p>

            <h2>Zalando and Mosaic9</h2>

            <p>More precisely, the picture became very clear when we got an e-mail from our boss telling us to look into
            the project <a href="https://www.mosaic9.org/">Mosaic9</a> from
            <a href="http://www.zalando.com/">Zalando</a>. From the project's site we learn that:</p>

            <blockquote>Mosaic is a set of services, libraries together with a specification that defines how its components interact with each other, to support a microservice style architecture for large scale websites.</blockquote>

            <p>When you start to browse through the material on Mosaic9, the first thing that comes to mind is that it's
            a project that deals with infrastructure to make a web application very fast. This idea is not far off. If
            you take a look at the Zalando store, browse it for a bit, you will notice that it's blazingly fast. If the
            underlying infrastructure of Zalando is actually Mosaic9 - then it's a pretty impressive infrastructure! The
            developers have thought things through :) Let's dive a bit deeper into what actually Mosaic9 is.</p>

            <h2>Micro frontends or BFF</h2>

            <p>Microservices have been around for a long time. This pattern is not really new for the world of back-end
            development. However, recently this concept started to emerge in the world of front-end development. With
            web applications becoming larger and larger, teams are starting to struggle to develop these monolithic applications.</p>

            <p>A very big pain is when you have several teams working on the same monolithic web application.
            This is something that my team found out as well, with our current large monolith (based on old tech, don't
            forget). It's hard to introduce new features without affecting other teams. It's hard to deliver some small
            changes to production without having to synchronize deployments with other teams. With code added, the
            overall application just becomes slower and slower.</p>

            <p>So how exactly can the concept of microservices be applied in the world of front-end web applications?
            A quick google on this topic will turn up many interesting resources.</p>
